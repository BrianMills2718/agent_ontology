description: >
  RAG agent that queries a knowledge graph via SPARQL instead of vector search.
  Demonstrates knowledge_graph store type with formalism and reasoner properties.
entry_point: receive_query

entities:
  - id: query_agent
    type: agent
    label: "Query Generator"
    model: "gemini-3-flash-preview"
    system_prompt: >
      You are a SPARQL query generator. Given a natural language question and a
      knowledge graph schema, generate a SPARQL query that retrieves relevant facts.
      Output only the SPARQL query, no explanation.

    type: agent
    label: "Answer Synthesizer"
    model: "gemini-3-flash-preview"
    system_prompt: >
      You synthesize answers from knowledge graph query results.
      Given the original question and SPARQL query results (as triples),
      generate a clear, factual answer grounded in the retrieved facts.
