      "question": "A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost in cents?",
      "answer": 5,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "Let ball = x. Bat = x + 1.00. x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10. 2x = 0.10. x = 0.05 = 5 cents. Common wrong answer: 10 cents."

      "question": "If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how many minutes would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?",
      "answer": 5,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "Each machine makes 1 widget in 5 minutes. 100 machines each make 1 widget in 5 minutes = 100 widgets in 5 minutes. Common wrong answer: 100 minutes."

      "question": "A lily pad doubles in size every day. If it takes 48 days for the lily pad to cover the entire lake, how many days does it take to cover half the lake?",
      "answer": 47,
      "steps": 2,
      "solution": "If it doubles daily and covers the whole lake on day 48, it covered half on day 47. Common wrong answer: 24."

      "question": "A store marks up a product by 25% and then offers a 25% discount. If the original cost is $100, what is the final selling price?",
      "answer": 93.75,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "After 25% markup: 100 * 1.25 = 125. After 25% discount: 125 * 0.75 = 93.75. Common wrong answer: 100 (thinking they cancel out)."

      "answer": 2,

      "question": "Three friends split a $30 dinner bill equally. They each pay $10. The waiter realizes the bill should have been $25 and gives back $5. They each take $1 back and leave $2 as a tip. Each person paid $9, totaling $27. Plus the $2 tip makes $29. Where did the extra $1 go? Just answer with how much total money was spent by the three friends.",
      "answer": 27,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "They each paid $9 = $27 total spent. Of that $27, the restaurant got $25 and the waiter got $2 tip. The $29 framing is misleading — you shouldn't add the tip to what they paid, it's part of it. Total spent = $27."

      "question": "A snail climbs 3 feet up a wall during the day but slides back 2 feet at night. The wall is 10 feet high. On which day does the snail reach the top?",
      "answer": 8,
      "steps": 4,
      "solution": "Days 1-7: net gain of 1 foot per day = 7 feet. Day 8: climbs 3 more feet to reach 10 feet during the day (doesn't slide back because it's at the top). Common wrong answer: 10."

      "answer": 3,
      "steps": 4,
      "solution": "After Alice: 12/2 = 6 left. After Bob: give 6/3 = 2, keep 4. After Carol: give 4/4 = 1, keep 3."

      "answer": 11,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "6 strikes have 5 intervals between them. 5 seconds / 5 intervals = 1 second per interval. 12 strikes have 11 intervals. 11 * 1 = 11 seconds. Common wrong answer: 10."

      "answer": 15,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "Speed = 100/5 = 20 m/s. To pass through tunnel, train travels its own length + tunnel length = 100 + 200 = 300 meters. Time = 300/20 = 15 seconds. Common wrong answer: 10."

      "answer": 3,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "1 cat catches 1 mouse in 3 minutes. In 100 minutes, 1 cat catches 100/3 = 33.3 mice. For 100 mice: 100/33.3 = 3 cats. Common wrong answer: 100."

      "question": "A ship has a ladder with rungs 30 cm apart. At low tide, 6 rungs are above water. If the tide rises at 15 cm per hour, how many rungs will be above water after 3 hours?",
      "answer": 6,
      "steps": 2,
      "solution": "The ship floats with the tide — it rises too. The number of rungs above water stays the same: 6. Common wrong answer: calculate based on water rising relative to a fixed ladder."

      "answer": 1,
      "steps": 2,
      "solution": "You can subtract 5 from 25 only once. After that, you're subtracting 5 from 20, then from 15, etc. The question asks how many times from 25 specifically. Common wrong answer: 5."

      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "First trade: 70-60 = +$10. Second trade: 90-80 = +$10. Total profit: $20. Common wrong answer: $10 (thinking buying back 'lost' money)."

      "question": "If you have a 3-gallon jug and a 5-gallon jug, and you need exactly 4 gallons of water, what is the minimum number of pour operations needed? (Filling from tap or emptying a jug counts as one operation each.)",
      "answer": 6,
      "steps": 6,
      "solution": "1. Fill 5-gallon. 2. Pour into 3-gallon (5->3, leaving 2 in 5-gallon). 3. Empty 3-gallon. 4. Pour 2 gallons from 5 into 3. 5. Fill 5-gallon. 6. Pour from 5 into 3 (3 has 2, needs 1 more, leaving 4 in 5-gallon). 6 operations."

      "answer": 10,
      "steps": 4,
      "solution": "Let second = x. First = 2x. Third = 2x - 3. Total: x + 2x + (2x-3) = 47. 5x - 3 = 47. 5x = 50. x = 10."

      "answer": 10,
      "steps": 4,
      "solution": "Let Bob's age = b. Alice = b + 4. In 6 years, Alice will be b + 4 + 6 = b + 10. This equals 2b. So b + 10 = 2b. b = 10."

The bellhop keeps $2 as a tip and gives $1 back to each person. Now each person paid $9 (total $27). The bellhop has $2. That's $29. What happened to the missing dollar? Answer with the actual total amount the three guests spent in dollars.",
      "answer": 27,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "The three guests spent $27 total. Of that $27, $25 went to the hotel and $2 to the bellhop. There is no missing dollar - the $29 framing is a misdirection (you shouldn't add the $2 tip to what they paid). Total spent = $27."

      "answer": 48,
      "steps": 4,
      "solution": "Time A→B: 120/40 = 3 hours. Time B→A: 120/60 = 2 hours. Total distance: 240 miles. Total time: 5 hours. Average speed: 240/5 = 48 mph. Common wrong answer: 50 (arithmetic mean of 40 and 60)."
