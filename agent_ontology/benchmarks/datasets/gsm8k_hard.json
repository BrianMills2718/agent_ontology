      "question": "Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?",
      "answer": 1000,
      "steps": 5,
      "solution": "Let p be the previous monthly income. Rent cost = 0.40 * p. New income = p + 600. New rent fraction: 0.25 * (p + 600). Since rent cost didn't change: 0.40p = 0.25(p + 600). 0.40p = 0.25p + 150. 0.15p = 150. p = 1000."

      "solution": "Regular pay per day: 8 * 18 = $144. Overtime hours per day: 10 - 8 = 2. Overtime rate: 18 + 18/2 = 18 + 9 = $27/hr. Overtime pay per day: 2 * 27 = $54. Total per day: 144 + 54 = $198. Weekly total: 198 * 5 = $990."

      "solution": "Let S be the number of people on the first ship. Second ship: 2S. Third ship: 4S. Total: S + 2S + 4S = 7S = 847. S = 847 / 7 = 121."

Remaining driving time: 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. Distance at 80 mph: 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles. Total distance driven back: 15 + 120 = 135 miles. Distance from home: 180 - 135 = 45 miles."

      "steps": 5,
      "solution": "Total money saved: 95 + 15 = $110. Allowance over 3 months: 3 * 5 = $15. Lawn mowing income: 4 * 15 = $60. Shoveling income: 110 - 15 - 60 = $35. Number of driveways: 35 / 7 = 5."

      "answer": 26,

      "solution": "Water from Pipe A alone for 4 hours: 250 * 4 = 1,000 gallons. Remaining: 12,000 - 1,000 = 11,000 gallons. Combined rate with both pipes and drain: 250 + 350 - 100 = 500 gallons/hour. Time to fill remaining: 11,000 / 500 = 22 hours. Total time: 4 + 22 = 26 hours."
