      "answer": 20,
      "steps": 3,
      "solution": "Morning + afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups. Total chickens = (unknown from per-meal, but let n = chickens). 3n = total feed. Actually: total feed given so far = 40. Total needed = 3n. Need to find n from morning: ... Simpler: total per day = 3 * (15+25+x)/3... Let's use: if 15+25=40 given, and she has 20 chickens (15+25+x = 60, x=20). Each chicken eats 3 cups total = 60 cups for 20 chickens. 60 - 40 = 20."
